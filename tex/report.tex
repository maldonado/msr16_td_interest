\section{Related Work}
\para{Technical debt}

\cite{Guo2011ICSM}: they track technical debt items and access its impact (cost) among incurred, deferred and paid. That said, they focused on only one event (WebDav protocol is not supported) and 

\para{Software Evolution: We calculate interest by looking at the difference size of two versions. In other words, this work is one of lines of software evolution.}

\section{Case Study Setup}
The goal of this study is \todo{purpose.}.
...

We formalize our study in the following research questions:

\todo{List up research question}

To conduct our case study, we use data from ...

\todo{How do we choose projects we analyze? i.e., why do we use Ant and Jmeter and do not use ArgoUML, Columba and JFreeChart? and why do we add jruby?}

Similar to previous work~\cite{Kamei2010ICSM,Kamei2013TSE}, we used churn as effort. We assume that developers spend their effort to check the method before modifying methods at least, we say that is the effort.

\para{Get Git repos}

\subsection{Interest}
To measure interest, we use source code metrics. We use Understand, which is a well-known tool, to measure source code metrics. 

\para{how to calculate metrics?}

In this study, we consider the relative size of ... as interest. For example, 

\para{how to identify when a technical debt are introduced and removed?}
From that version, we obtain patches between two versions over all versions for each file that includes technical debt. Then, we check each patch about whether or not technical debt is introduced/removed. Some of them are not removed. If so, we use latest commits. We calculate the difference of a metric between two versions when technical debt is introduced and removed.

\section{Results}
\subsection{RQ1: Can we quantify interest of technical debt at the function-level?}
\smallsection{Motivation}
\todo{need to read some papers that say technical debt is bad. So we want to quantify it.}

\smallsection{Approach}
\para{We calculate the interest.}

\smallsection{Results}

Put Table.

\conclusionbox{Result of RQ1: 22\%-36\% of technical debt has positive interest.}

\subsection{RQ2: Does the interest differ based on the type of technical debt?}
\smallsection{Motivation}
There are several type of technical debt such as defect technical debt and design technical debt. 
To better understand the interest, we would like to analayze ...

\smallsection{Approach}
We classify technical debt into categories and calculate interest in each category.

\smallsection{Results}
Table X shows the number and the percentage of technical debt. Among three projects, jruby only includes more than one category that has more than 10\% of technical debt methods. Therefore, we decided to use jruby in RQ2.

\para{we report same things in RQ1.}
