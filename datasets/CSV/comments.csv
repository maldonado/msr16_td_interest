They had been in a weak hash map, but since almost all of them were linked to proxies that were in non-weak maps, there was really no benefit (and some performance penalties).  - Used concurrent techniques to speed proxy class lookup.  Proxies are now stored with their corresponding JavaClass instances, and can be retrieved with an unsynchronized access.  - Eliminated the ProxyData ""dataStruct"" that had been attached to the JavaUtilities module; most of the fields (maps) had been eliminated in the work noted above; the remaining fields have been moved to JavaSupport where they may be accessed without a JavaUtilities reference.  - Permanently disabled the the old-style (<) interface implementation syntax (there had been a method to enable it; no more).  - Fixed a bug wherein the colon2 syntax for opening modules was not working if the module had not previously been referenced.

DESIGN,// see note below re: 2-field kludge,2007-09-21,Bill Dortch,"More JI cleanup:  - Reworked the very expensive and thread-unsafe (and essentially obsolete) proxy extender mechanism. No longer is every new proxy checked against all proxy extenders; since the Rubification of the Java class hierarchy, it's really only necessary to extend the class/module specified in the extend_proxy method. I'd like to see this feature deprecated, as it's redundant now (see forthcoming note on jruby-dev).  - Moved JavaClass instances to a ConcurrentHashMap for faster access.  They had been in a weak hash map, but since almost all of them were linked to proxies that were in non-weak maps, there was really no benefit (and some performance penalties).  - Used concurrent techniques to speed proxy class lookup.  Proxies are now stored with their corresponding JavaClass instances, and can be retrieved with an unsynchronized access.  - Eliminated the ProxyData ""dataStruct"" that had been attached to the JavaUtilities module; most of the fields (maps) had been eliminated in the work noted above; the remaining fields have been moved to JavaSupport where they may be accessed without a JavaUtilities reference.  - Permanently disabled the the old-style (<) interface implementation syntax (there had been a method to enable it; no more).  - Fixed a bug wherein the colon2 syntax for opening modules was not working if the module had not previously been referenced.
