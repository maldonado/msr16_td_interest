 * ViewFs (extends the AbstractFileSystem interface) implements a client-side
 * mount table. The viewFs file system is implemented completely in memory on
 * the client side. The client-side mount table allows a client to provide a 
 * customized view of a file system namespace that is composed from 
 * one or more individual file systems (a localFs or Hdfs, S3fs, etc).
 * For example one could have a mount table that provides links such as
 * <ul>
 * <li>  /user          -> hdfs://nnContainingUserDir/user
 * <li>  /project/foo   -> hdfs://nnProject1/projects/foo
 * <li>  /project/bar   -> hdfs://nnProject2/projects/bar
 * <li>  /tmp           -> hdfs://nnTmp/privateTmpForUserXXX
 * </ul> 
 * 
 * ViewFs is specified with the following URI: <b>viewfs:///</b> 
 * <p>
 * To use viewfs one would typically set the default file system in the
 * config  (i.e. fs.default.name< = viewfs:///) along with the
 * mount table config variables as described below. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b> ** Config variables to specify the mount table entries ** </b>
 * <p>
 * 
 * The file system is initialized from the standard Hadoop config through
 * config variables.
 * See {@link FsConstants} for URI and Scheme constants; 
 * See {@link Constants} for config var constants; 
 * see {@link ConfigUtil} for convenient lib.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All the mount table config entries for view fs are prefixed by 
 * <b>fs.viewfs.mounttable.</b>
 * For example the above example can be specified with the following
 *  config variables:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./user=
 *  hdfs://nnContainingUserDir/user
 *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./project/foo=
 *  hdfs://nnProject1/projects/foo
 *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./project/bar=
 *  hdfs://nnProject2/projects/bar
 *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./tmp=
 *  hdfs://nnTmp/privateTmpForUserXXX
 *  </ul>
 *  
 * The default mount table (when no authority is specified) is 
 * from config variables prefixed by <b>fs.viewFs.mounttable.default </b>
 * The authority component of a URI can be used to specify a different mount
 * table. For example,
 * <ul>
 * <li>  viewfs://sanjayMountable/
 * </ul>
 * is initialized from fs.viewFs.mounttable.sanjayMountable.* config variables.
 * 
 *  <p> 
 *  <b> **** Merge Mounts **** </b>(NOTE: merge mounts are not implemented yet.)
 *  <p>
 *  
 *   One can also use ""MergeMounts"" to merge several directories (this is
 *   sometimes  called union-mounts or junction-mounts in the literature.
 *   For example of the home directories are stored on say two file systems
 *   (because they do not fit on one) then one could specify a mount
 *   entry such as following merges two dirs:
 *   <ul>
 *   <li> /user -> hdfs://nnUser1/user,hdfs://nnUser2/user
 *   </ul>
 *  Such a mergeLink can be specified with the following config var where "",""
 *  is used as the separator for each of links to be merged:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.linkMerge./user=
 *  hdfs://nnUser1/user,hdfs://nnUser1/user
 *  </ul>
 *   A special case of the merge mount is where mount table's root is merged
 *   with the root (slash) of another file system:
 *   <ul>
 *   <li>    fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.linkMergeSlash=hdfs://nn99/
 *   </ul>
 *   In this cases the root of the mount table is merged with the root of
 *            <b>hdfs://nn99/ </b>
