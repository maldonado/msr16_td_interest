\begin{abstract}
Technical debt refers to the phenomena of taking a shortcut to achieve short term development gain at the the cost of increased maintenance effort in the future. The concept of debt, inparticular, the cost of debt has not been widely studied. Therrefore, the goal of this paper is to determine ways to measure the `interest' on the debt and use these measures to see how much of the technical debt incurs positive interest, i.e., debt that indeed costs more to pay off in the future. To measure interest, we use the LOC and Fan-In measures. We perform a case study on the Apache JMeter project and find that approximately 42 - 44\% of the technical debt incurs positive interest.
%do we know how much interest we are paying on the technical debt in software development projects?
%To tackle this problem, we aim to quntify interest of Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) using analytics
%such as software metrics and automatic SATD detection techniques. We conduct an initial case study using the dataset collected
%from the Apache JMeter projet. The results show that 44.2\% of technical debt has a positive rate in terms of LOC and 42.2\% of technical debt has it in terms of Fan-In.
