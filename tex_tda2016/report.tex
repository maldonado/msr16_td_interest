\begin{abstract}
The metaphor of technical debt has been well studied. However, 
do we know how much interest we are paying on the technical debt in software development projects?
To tackle this problem, we aim to quntify interest of Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) using analytics
such as software metrics and automatic SATD detection techniques. We conduct an initial case study using the dataset collected
from the Apache JMeter projet. The results show that 44.2\% of technical debt has a positive rate in terms of LOC and 42.2\% of technical debt has it in terms of Fan-In.
